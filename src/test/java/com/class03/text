Why do we need Xpath and Css?
1. Developers will not provide all the locators in the HTML
2. By using xpath or css locator we can find actually the element.

 //DOM document object model
What is Xpath?
Xpath is a query language which helps to identity elements uniquely on the web page.


There is two types of Xpath
They are Absolute Xpath also known as full xpath. It always start from the start of Html. It's start with single /.



Relative Xpath--> Start from any nodes of html . Starts with double forward slash //.
Syntax //tagname[@attribute='value']
eg //a[text()= 'Fashion']

Contains while identify element with a partial attribute value.
// tag name[contains(@attribute,'partial attribute value']
eg //input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')] This is the best xpath.
//a[contains(text(), 'Create New')]

Starts with --> will identify the element with starting partial value
//tagname[starts-with@attribute,'partial starting value']

Ends
